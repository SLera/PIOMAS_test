The daily NAO index is constructed by properly projecting the daily (00Z) 
500mb height anomalies over the Northern Hemsiphere onto the loading pattern 
of the NAO.
The loading pattern of the NAO is defined as the first leading mode of 
Roated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis of monthly mean 500mb 
height during 1950-2000 period.  
  
The daily NAO index and its forecasts using MRF and Ensemble mean forecast data 
are shown for the previous 120 days as indicated and they are normalized by 
standard deviation of the monthly NAO index from 1950 to 2000. A 3-day running 
mean is applied for the forecast indices.
